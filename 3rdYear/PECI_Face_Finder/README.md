#   Face Recognition
Developed as a final project for my bachelorâ€™s degree, the application leverages a web-based application for managing photos of people in large events using computer vision techniques.
I took on the backend role and was responsible for the following developments: 
- Developed API with FastAPI
- Face Recognition Service using Deepface
- Database Design using Supabase (PostreSQL)
- Implemented asynchronous task queuing with RabbitMQ.
- Containerized services using Docker and Docker Compose for streamlined deployment.
